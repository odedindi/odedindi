- 👋 Hi, I’m Oded
- 👀 I’m interested in many things.. first of all diving, after that I love breaking things apart to small pieces and then build them back again :)
- 🌱 Promising young full-stacker.
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate on different kinds of software and web development both front and back ends.
- 📫 How to reach me, best is to email me to odedindi@gmail.com, and most of the time I reply rather quickly
